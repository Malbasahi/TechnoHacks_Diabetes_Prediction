# TechnoHacks_Diabetes_Prediction
The Diabetes Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical features. This project is valuable for healthcare professionals and patients as it can assist in early diagnosis and proactive management of diabetes, which is a prevalent and chronic health condition worldwide.

# Key Components:

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing medical data of patients, including features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI (Body Mass Index), diabetes pedigree function, and age. The target variable is "Outcome," indicating whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the project. It involves handling missing values, feature scaling (normalization), and potentially addressing class imbalance. Missing values are imputed with appropriate statistics like the median. Standard scaling ensures that features are on the same scale, improving the performance of machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory Data Analysis techniques, such as visualizations (scatter plots, pair plots), summary statistics, and correlation analysis, are employed to understand the relationships between features and the distribution of data. EDA helps in identifying patterns and insights that can guide feature selection and engineering.

Model Selection: Multiple classification algorithms are considered for building the predictive model. These algorithms include:

Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
Gradient Boosting
AdaBoost
K-Nearest Neighbors
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is used to fine-tune hyperparameters for each model. This process involves searching through various hyperparameter combinations to find the ones that yield the best model performance.

Handling Class Imbalance: The project addresses class imbalance in the dataset by using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create synthetic samples of the minority class (diabetes) during the model training phase.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Cross-validation is employed to ensure robust model performance assessment.

Model Comparison: A comparison of model performances is conducted to identify the best-performing classifier in terms of accuracy.

Visualization: Visualizations, such as pair plots, scatter plots, and a bar chart comparing model accuracies, are created to provide a better understanding of feature relationships and the relative performance of different models.

Future Enhancements: The project suggests future enhancements to achieve higher accuracy, including advanced feature engineering, exploring different algorithms (e.g., XGBoost), collecting more data, and considering deep learning approaches.
